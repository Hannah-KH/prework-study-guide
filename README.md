# Prework Study Guide Webpage
## Description

The purpose of this project was to put into practice what I learnt from the prework of a frontend web development bootcamp. It helped consolidate my learning as I was 'doing' rather than just reading and taking notes. I also went over my written notes when adding content to the page. I learnt how much fun coding is, and how much I enjoy engaging the logical side of my brain!
